          <h1>About Calories</h1>
          <p>Calories aren't bad for you. Your body needs calories for energy.
            But eating too many calories — and not burning enough of them off through activity —
            can lead to weight gain.
            Most foods and drinks contain calories. Some foods, such as lettuce, contain few calories (1 cup of shredded
            lettuce has less than 10 calories).
            Other foods, like peanuts, contain a lot of calories (½ cup of peanuts has 427 calories).</p>
          <p>You can find out how many calories are in a food by looking at the nutrition facts label.
            The label also will describe the components of the food — how many grams of carbohydrate,
            protein, and fat it contains.
            Here's how many calories are in 1 gram of each:
          <br/>

           <span><b>carbohydrate — 4 calories</b></span>
            <br/>
           <span><b>protein — 4 calories</b></span>
            <br/>
           <span><b>fat — 9 calories</b></span>

        <h4>The best option</h4>
        <p>We’re always hearing how a certain vitamin or herbal supplement will cure a chronic
         condition or drastically improve the quality of our lives. However, information about dietary 
         supplements is often confusing or unclear. It’s hard to know which offer genuine health benefits 
         and which are merely giving false promises, or worse, running the risk of actually damaging your health.

        <h4>Program exercises</h4>
        <p>Starting a fitness journey can be intimidating, especially if you're going in without any previous study.
         If you go to the Internet to find information, you might find yourself smack-dab in the middle of bad logic and bad ideas. 
         It's difficult to sort out the fact from the fiction—especially when the fiction sounds so good..</p>

        <h4>Why fruits?</h4>
        <p>There's no doubt that eating fruit is important to our overall health and wellbeing.
         Fruit is healthy for you, we all know that, but, it's good to know that eating it should follow some general guidelines 
         to fully benefit our health. It's just not as simple as putting it into our mouths whenever we feel like it. 
         </p>

        <h4>Healthy eating</h4>
        <p>Here are three main reasons that will help remind you that eating healthy is the best choice to make for your diet:
         To provide the necessary nutrients that your body needs to create new cells, clean toxins, and to just function every day!
          Eating healthy now can help prevent future diseases such as diabetes and cancer.</p>
